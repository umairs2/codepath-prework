## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Duolingo:
- Very friendly user design
- Makes learning a language go from complex to easy
- Satisfying animations that make the app alive

Bevel:
- Strength training feature allows you to see which body parts are being worked the most
- Clean UI to help digest information easier

Family: 
- Makes sending crypto very easy with one of the most simple UI
- Satisfying animations to make the experience fun

App Idea:
    An app that blocks your social media & games on your phone to force you to digest bite-sized
    information for 2-5 minutes before unlocking the apps. The idea is that we all know brain rotting is
    bad for us, but what if we could turn it into a slightly more productive habit that makes you more
    knowledgeable and smarter.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The process was fairly simple, but just took a few minutes to find where all the buttons were located
